There might still be some issue with the loading of the graphs in page Dashboard and Tracks Page List section.
Please reload a couple of times if You are not rendered with charts.

The Tracks Page list is just placed there temporarily for convenience. 
localhost:9000/#/dashboard/chart?trackid=sometrackid will retrieve the graph for you(else you will keep running into an errors page)
